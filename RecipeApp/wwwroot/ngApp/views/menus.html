<h2> Here is where I want to store my menus.  It'd be cool to show them in little rectangles, like a menu on a piece of paper, and hide the text overflow.  Then when you click on one, you of course go to the menu details page</h2>

<div ng-repeat="m in controller.menus">
    {{m.name}}
    <div ng-repeat="r in m.recipes">
        {{r.title}}
    </div>
</div>
